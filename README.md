## Summary
Looking at the temperature trends for December and June, the maximum temperatures have a difference of 2 degrees, the minimum temperatures have a difference of 8 degrees, and the mean temperatures have a difference of 3.9 degrees. The range between the maximum and minimum temperatures for the month of December is larger than the month of June, so there is a possibility of warmer temperatures in December or colder temperatures in December. 

It would be useful to gather summary statistics on precipitation for the months of December and June in order to help determine if the business will be sustainable all year round. Therefore, it is recommended to gather summary statistics of precipitation for the months of December and June.

We have a minimum temperature for December, but that may not be the coldest time of the year. Therefore, it is recommended to gather temperature trends (summary statistics) for the months of January and February to see when the coldest part of the year is and how cold it could get.
